Music Store Data Analysis

This project involved a comprehensive analysis of a music store's sales data to provide key business insights. The goal was to identify top-performing artists, genres, and customer purchasing habits to inform business strategy.

Tools & Technologies:
SQL: Used for data cleaning, manipulation, and querying.

Key Questions & Insights:

This analysis was driven by a series of business questions that a music store owner would ask:
1. Who is the senior most employee based on job title? 
2. Which countries have the most Invoices? 
3. What are top 3 values of total invoice? 
4. Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music 
Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns one city that 
has the highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name & sum of all invoice 
totals.
